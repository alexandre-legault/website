# Alexandre Legault
I study the social and political dimensions of climate adaptation in rural communities. I specifically seek to understand how Nova Scotia's municipalities seek, identify, and use information in policy development and implementation. I am also actively involved in a range of practitioner-led climate adaptation projects.
